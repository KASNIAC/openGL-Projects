----- Graphs drawer -----<br>
This program draws a simple undirected graph. I usually use it for competitive programming problems where it is important to visualize the graph. <br>

Use:
Just run "compile.bat", after the draw-graph.exe program is generated, you just have to run it. <br>

Input: The first number is the number of vertex on the graph, followed by the number of edges. Subsequently as many pairs of numbers as there are edges. <br>

Input Example:<br>
6<br>
4<br>
0 5<br>
2 4<br>
2 3<br>
4 3<br>
