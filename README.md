----- Grapgs drawer -----<br>
This program draws a simple undirected graph. I usually use it for competitive programming problems where it is important to visualize the graph. <br>

Use:
Just run "compile.bat", after the draw-graph.exe program is generated, you just have to run it. <br>

Input Example:
6
4
0 5
2 4
2 3
4 3
